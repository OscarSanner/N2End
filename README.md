# N2End
(WIP) End to end encrypted terminal chat application for UNIX systems written in C++ with nCurses

## Purpose
This is initally a project to further my understanding in a C++ and to see simple encryption algorithms such as diffie hellman in play. However, the grand idea (epic) is for N2End to be a combination of server and client software. That means that anyone could install the server on any hardware, and have their friends use the client, connected to that specific server. In other words there wont be a single centralized server to store messages and users. Users will rather set the server up themselves.

## How it will work
A user can have conversations with other users, but not in group. It will offer a very simple interface.
